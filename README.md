# Clarity

[Clarity](https://clarity.microsoft.com/) is a behavioral analysis tool that helps you understand how users view and use your application. Understanding how users navigate and interact with your application can provide new insights about your users. Empathizing with your users and seeing where features fail or succeed can help improve your product, grow revenue and improve user retention.
